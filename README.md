# Veggie slicer
 A Fruit Ninja inspired game where the main idea is to swipe through a variety of objects and earn points. 

The game also includes a lives system, pause functionality, 3 different difficulties, and volume slider that allows the player to adjust the music volume at the start of the game.

Besides all the additional features that need to be implemented according to the task, I also added a few by myself such as:
- Lives UI as an actual hearts
- Background music (stops on "game over")
- Swoosh sound effect
- Bombs subtract lives, not points
- Points and lives not showing up while in the menu
